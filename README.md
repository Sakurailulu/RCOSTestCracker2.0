# RCOSTestCracker2.0
RPI Backtest system (Java)
This is an improving version of RCOS TestCraker which developed in Fall2019.

Test Cracker is an Android application for RPI students to improve efficiency and keep track of important academic events. The main functionality of the application is to collect backtests for all the courses in RPI and share them to all users. It is originally a Software Design and Documentation Project which has been developed for one semester. We are looking forward to implementing new features and improving the features that we already have.
